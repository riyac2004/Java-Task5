Task5 Data Analysis

**Project Description: Data Analysis Console Application**
The Data Analysis Console Application is a simple Java-based program developed to analyze numerical data using arrays. The application allows users to store multiple values in a single-dimensional array and perform essential statistical operations such as calculating the sum, average, maximum, and minimum values. To improve logical thinking and algorithmic skills, the program implements manual sorting of data without using Java’s built-in sorting methods.
In addition, the project demonstrates the use of multi-dimensional arrays by displaying matrix-style data, helping users understand data representation in tabular form. The application uses efficient looping techniques for array traversal and includes exception handling to manage runtime errors like ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, ensuring program stability.

**Advantages of the Project**
>> Simple and easy-to-understand implementation.
>> Improves logical and analytical thinking skills.
>> No external libraries required — uses core Java only.
>> Demonstrates multiple Java concepts in a single application.
>> Well-structured and suitable for educational purposes.
>> Enhances understanding of error handling and program stability.

**Limitations of the Project**
>> Limited to small datasets due to static array size.
>> Console-based interface — no graphical user interface (GUI).
>> Manual sorting is less efficient for large data compared to built-in algorithms.
>> Does not support file handling or database storage.
>> Provides basic analysis only; advanced statistical operations are not included.
